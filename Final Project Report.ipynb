The Toronto neighborhood location DataFrame was fed into a KMeans clustering algorithm, and then displayed on a folium map to visualize said clusters.  </p>\n\n<p> After exploring potential neighborhood clusters, the FourSquare API was used to get information about popular venues for each neighborhood using the explore query. This information was appended to a main DataFrame, then cleaned to improve readability. This included removing unimportant columns such as ...... and ......, as well as deleting any duplicate venues that may have appeared, since the search radius of each neighborhood was set to 2 miles.

There is one notable exception, but that cluster is likely due to being located at the city center, which would naturally have a higher population density. </p>\n\n<p>There isn't much that can be deduced from the the venues map due to its incompleteness.
